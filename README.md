The Gaming Room is a client that wants to expand its Android application "Draw It or Lose It" to multiple platforms including Linux, Mac, Windows, and other mobile systems. The main goal was to assess each system's characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses to ensure effective deployment across all platforms. In development, I excelled in providing a clear detailed analysis of each platform, which was important in guiding the clientâ€™s decision-making process. It was beneficial to go through a design document and utilize the UML diagram because it gave the requirements a structured blueprint for the application. If I were to revise one aspect I would add a detailed cost and resource estimation section to better outline the initial and long-term investments needed. When working for a client such as The Gaming Room it is crucial to consider their needs to ensure the software meets their expectations and operational requirements. By focusing on these needs it can improve user satisfaction,  usability, and overall engagement. I evaluated the characteristics of each platform to determine how best to optimize the application for performance and compatibility. In future projects, I would like to get user feedback to ensure that the software and design evolves with their needs.
